    <h3>An easy recipe to quench your thirst for lemons and blueberries</h3>
    <p>This recipe was inspired by my love for blueberries and lemonade. It is also
        inspired by the fact that I only have those two things in my fridge. I hope you 
        have lemons and blueberries in your fridge too.
